# Add CSV source

If you have your product up and running, you should be receiving a bunch of emails, in app-feedbacks or conducting qualitative questionnaires with your customers. The purpose is to improve your product or services, but you are definitely struggling with analysing bulk of data in CSV or Excel files. That is why, on top of the Google Play And Apple Store reviews, Applysis can import and analyse any CSV files for you.

Analysis process is simple, it consists of **two main steps:**

-   [Prepare CSV File](#prepare-csv)
-   [Import & Analyse](#import-analyse)

##### Prepare CSV File

Once you upload your final CSV file, Applysis will start searching for specific columns in it. It is mandatory to have **Text** column filled in the file. Here is the more detailed description about columns we expect the file to have.

-   **Text**: mandatory, e.g review text, email body etc.
-   **Title**: optional, e.g email subject, question, review title etc.
-   **Date**: optional.
-   **Rating**: optional, e.g review rating, we expect it to be minimum 1, maximum 5
-   **Author**: optional, e.g user name, email address.
-   **Region**: optional, it can hold any region value you desire e.g country, city, county.
-   **Version**: optional, e.g 1.5, 1.6.1 etc.
