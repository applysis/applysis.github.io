# Swift Package

Applysis Swift Package gives the opportunity to submit feedback automatically from iOS, OSX, WatchOS or TVOS apps directly to the [Applysis platform](https://app.applysis.io/). SDK can be used as Swift Package Manager and downloaded from [github repository](https://github.com/applysis/applysis-ios-sdk).

## Supported Versions

-   iOS from 13.0
-   OSX from 10.15
-   TVOS from 13.0
-   WatchOS from 6.0

## Usage

Before you start using the Package, you should add a new API source on Applysis platform and generate the secret key. All details are explained [here.](http://docs.applysis.io/)

### Initialising

Import `Applysis` in AppDelegate.swift and add initalisiation in `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions`.

`Applysis.initalise(with: "your-secret-key")`

#### Debug Mode

If you wish to enable the debug mode you can call:
`Applysis.shared.enableDebugMode()`
It will log all network parameters, headers, body and response. It will help you debug bad requests or any other issues.

### Submission

Applysis SDK provides the `Feedback` structure which contains:

-   **text**: mandatory, e.g review text, email body etc.
-   **title**: optional, e.g email subject, question, review title etc.
-   **date**: optional.
-   **rating**: optional, e.g review rating, we expect it to be minimum 1, maximum 5
-   **author**: optional, e.g user name, email address.
-   **region**: optional, it can hold any region value you desire e.g country, city, county.
-   **version**: optional, e.g 1.5, 1.6.1 etc.

SDK uses Combine to notify callee about the submission success or failure. So, initialise `Feedback` structure with the data you want to submit and then submit it with the SDK.

```
let feedback =
    Feedback(
        text: "Sending messages fails, please fix ASAP!",
        title: "Bug on message sending",
        date: Date(),
        rating: nil, author: nil, region: nil, version: nil
    )

Applysis.shared.submitFeedback(feedback)
    .sink(receiveCompletion: { [weak self] resp in
        switch resp {
            case .finished:  break // finished
            case .failure: break // error
        }
    }, receiveValue: { [weak self] _ in
        // success
    })
    .store(in: &cancellables)
```

##### Submission by batches

Submission can be done batch by batch. You can use `Applysis.shared.submitFeedbacks(_ feedbacks: [Feedback])` to submit a maximum 50 feedbacks at a time.

If feedback(s) was successfully submitted, it should be visible on the [Applysis platform](https://app.applysis.io/) in maximum next 10-15 minutes.

## Limitations

-   You can not submit more than 50 feedbacks at a single batch.
-   With the current plans, you can submit a maximum 2000 feedbacks in a month.
-   `text` field can not be `nil` or empty.
